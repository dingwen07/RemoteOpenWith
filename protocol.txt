-- Open File Protocol
Protocol Version: 0.1

Other details: All strings are UTF-8 encoded, and all numbers are in decimal format.
Each command, except FileData, are terminated with TELNET EOL (0x0D 0x0A).
FileData can be arbitrary, so we cannot use TELNET EOL to terminate it.
Instead, we use the length of the data to determine the end of the FileData.

The Protocol:
